Password Strength Checker

This script evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria. It helps users create stronger, more secure passwords by checking for the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, special characters, and a minimum length requirement.

How It Works:

Criteria for a Strong Password:

Minimum Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Uppercase Letters: The password must include at least one uppercase letter.

Lowercase Letters: The password must include at least one lowercase letter.

Digits: The password must contain at least one numeric digit.

Special Characters: The password must have at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).

Password Evaluation:

The script uses regular expressions to check if the input password meets all the required criteria.

It provides feedback if the password is too short or lacks any of the necessary components.

If all conditions are satisfied, the password is considered strong.
